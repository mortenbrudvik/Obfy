# Changelog

All notable changes to Obfy will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Aggressive and AES obfuscation now produce loadable, runnable assemblies (constant decryptors, empty-stack control-flow splits, crypto types referenced from their real assemblies)
- Source switch flattening no longer emits CS0161, wraps declarations, or splits `out var` / local functions across cases
- Source symbol renaming is semantic (ISymbol), including attributes and record positional properties
- String/constant encryption and control-flow record skipped try/catch methods instead of silently leaving them unprotected
- Resource encryption decrypts only encrypted names, rewrites only `Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(string)`, and warns on other load paths
- Control-flow fails the run instead of returning success after a half-rewritten method body, and does not split IL prefixes
- Anti-debug warns when no call site could be instrumented; anti-tamper fail-closes if the hash blob is missing
- Skips and warnings are shown in CLI/UI output and exported reports, not only in `--report`
- Anti-dump enabled produces an explicit “not implemented” warning; UI overall status reports file failures
- Assembly string encryption now decrypts at runtime (AES-256 and XOR) instead of returning ciphertext
- Anti-tamper hash excludes the stored digest so Aggressive builds no longer exit on startup
- Resource encryption keeps embedded resources and unwraps `GetManifestResourceStream`
- Custom CLI flags, UI toggles, and IDE settings are no longer overwritten by level presets
- CLI exits with code 1 and does not print success when obfuscation fails
- Added `--anti-tamper`, `--anti-decompiler`, `--no-string-encryption`, and `--no-symbol-renaming` so VS/Rider Custom mode matches the CLI
- Symbol renaming no longer breaks virtuals or implicit interface implementations
- Source obfuscation no longer rewrites attribute arguments or leaves constructors unrenamed
- Source switch flattening skips methods with locals/`break`/`continue`
- Missing config files, invalid `--level`, and `--merge` with one file now error instead of silently continuing
- CI runs on Windows so WPF projects can build
